# Advent of code 2019

I suggest you first take a look at the [website
yourself][the-website].

I am probably going to solve all assignments in Haskell.

This repo is not meant for cheating, but if you want to compare your own answers
to mine or if you're interested in how a Haskell solution might look.

The programs here are stack scripts. If you have the tool
[`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org) installed you should be able to just
execute the source files directly on the shell with `src/DayX.hs`.

I do not commit the inputs to the program, you have to look at the exercises on
[the website][the-website] yourself. For the programs that read them I usually
put them in a `input/dayX.txt` file and that's the location expected by the
programs.
